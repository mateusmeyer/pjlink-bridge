# pjlink-bridge

This is a library to help on the implementation of PJLink bridges.
For now, it provides a opinionated implementation and a builtin TCP/UDP server to listen to incoming PJLink.

## Sample implementations
- mock-bridge (in /examples directory; it's an implementation of a virtual projector to test the `pjlink-bridge` capabilities (or to test PJLink clients);
- [pjlink-rs232-bridge](https://github.com/mateusmeyer/pjlink-rs232-bridge/)

## What's missing for now:
- Proper UDP support
